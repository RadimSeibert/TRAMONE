Air mass trajectory-based monitoring network software and input data.
Work within the project TAÄŒR SS07010003.
Aims:
- Develop an inteligent autonomous system of atmospheric aerosol sampling usable for the source
apportionment.
- Verify benefits of the new monitoring system by the comparison with the conventional sampling
method at three sites.
- Provide new information on air pollution sources at three sites.
